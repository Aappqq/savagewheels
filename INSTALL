3) Installation on Linux platforms
3.1) Requirements:
  * libSDL 1.2.x - You should install this using your package manager.
  * FMod Ex API - Install using your package manager or get the package from FMod's website.
  * CMake 2.6 and above
  * (Ubuntu specific) Install the package - build-essential

3.2) Instructions

1. Download the sources from the repository.

2. Install the libSDL package using the package manager on your Linux distribution.

3. Install the FMod Ex package using the package manager on your Linux distribution or get the package from FMod's website.

4. Download the Savage Wheels data files. You will need those, since they contain all graphics, sound, and vehicles data.
   Extract the downloaded archive into the bin/ folder. The important folders are - autos/, graphics/, sounds/.

5. Run the build script - build.sh
   $ ./build.sh
   
   This will create a folder build.tmp/ the "Ready For Playing" game.
   To start the game run:
   $ ./savagewheels
   
If you experience problems follow the steps below:   
   
1. You can also run CMake manually. Go to the release/ sub folder and run.
   $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
   
   To build without sound & music run:
   $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DNO_SOUND=1

2. Build with:
   $ make

3. Copy the produced binary file -> "savagewheels" to the bin/ folder.

4. Ok, you're done :) Go to the bin/ folder and start the game using the "savagewheels" binary.


4) Installation on Windows
4.1) Requirements
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

4.2) Instructions

1. Download the sources from the repository.

2. Download the Savage Wheels data files. You will need those, since they contain all graphics, sound, and vehicles data.
   Extract the downloaded archive into the relative bin\ folder. The important folders are - autos/, graphics/, sounds/.

3. Open the solution (.sln) file in your VS2005. 

4. Choose "Release" (or "Debug") from the Build settings and compile.

5. All the required files should be available in the relative \bin folder. You should be able to start the EXE file from there.

5) Compiling a Debug version

When issuing the command:
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt
You will create a makefile for a Release build of the game. If not let me know ;)

If you want to build a Debug version to catch a bug or something use the following:
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
