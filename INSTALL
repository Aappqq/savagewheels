Last updated on 20 May 2013

1) Supported Platforms
  * Linux x86/x64
  * Windows x86/x64
  * Tested on Linux distros - Archlinux/Ubuntu/Debian
  * Tested on Windows XP/2003/Vista

2) Compile requirements

Get the latest source code from GitHub:

    git clone git://github.com/petarov/savagewheels.git savagewheels

Get the data files from https://code.google.com/p/savagewheels.
You will need those since they contain all graphics, sound, and vehicles data. 
Extract the downloaded archive into the bin/ folder. 
(The important folders are - autos/, graphics/, sounds/)

3) Installation on Linux platforms

3.1) Requirements:
  * libSDL 1.2.x - You should install this using your package manager.
  * FMod Ex API - Install using your package manager or get the package from FMod's website.
  * CMake 2.8 and above
  * (Ubuntu specific) Install 'build-essential' package.

3.2) Instructions

	a) Install the libSDL package using the package manager on your Linux distribution.

	b) Install the FMod Ex package using the package manager on your Linux distribution or get 
	the package from FMod's website.

	c) Run the build script - build.sh
   	$ ./build.sh
   
   	d) Go to the 'release/' subfolder. Extract the produced archive file, 
   	e.g., savagewheels-1.5.0-Linux-x64.tar.gz to your desired Games folder.
   	
	e) Start the game run:
	$ ./savagewheels  
	or
	$ ./run.sh
	
	The 'run.sh' script will attempt to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in case you are missing libSDL
	or FModEx shared object libraries.
   
	If you experience problems with the automated 'build.sh' script you can try to build manually.
   
	a) You can also run CMake manually. Go to the release/ sub folder and run.
	$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
   
	Or to build without sound & music run:
	$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DNO_SOUND=1

	b) Build with:
	$ make
   
	c) Create the installation package with:
	$ cpack
	
	Debian/Ubuntu users may also run:
	$ cpack -G DEB
	This will create a .deb package that you can install with, e.g.,
	$ dpkg -i savagewheels-1.5.0-Linux-x64.deb

4) Installation on Windows

4.1) Requirements
  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
  * libSDL 1.2.x - Download the Development Libraries archive.
  * FMod Ex API - Download and install the FMOD Ex API installer EXE.

4.2) Instructions

TODO: (CMake setup not completed!)

You can try to compile using the available VS solution file (.sln).
You will need to generate the Config.h in src/ yourself. Use the template Config.h.in.

5) Compiling a Debug version

To build a Debug version to catch a bug or something use the following:

	$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug
