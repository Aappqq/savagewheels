This folder contains third party libraries required to compile the game for Windows (using MinGW).

  * Download libSDL 1.2 from [here](http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php) and extract it in this folder.
  * Download FMOD Ex API from [here](http://www.fmod.org/fmod-downloads.html#FMODExProgrammersAPI) and copy the FMod *api* folder here into a subfolder called *fmod*.

Note that many linux systems do not have the FMOD Ex package therefore if you compile on systems like Debian, Ubuntu you will need to follow step 2.
