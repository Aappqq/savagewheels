_.o0 SavageWheels 0o._
==========================

Savage Wheels is a 2D car crashing arcade game, where up to 2 to 4 vehicles take part in a deadly tournament.The goal is to eliminate the other derby contestants. Players may choose from a variety of vehicles, each with it's unique characteristics like speed, acceleration, armor, damage and driver. Various bonuses may be collected during the match to increase the vehicle speed and damage or to repair it.

Gameplay modes include a campaign, hot-seat mode between two players or melee mode where vehicles are controlled by a _fearsome_ game AI ;-).

All drivers have background stories which are uncovered in the campaign mode.
